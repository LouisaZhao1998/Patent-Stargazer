9141673,2015-09-22,12,B2,Cloud-based phone system with methodologies for suggesting account configuration settings,"A cloud-based phone system with methodologies for suggesting account configuration settings is provided. In one embodiment, for example, techniques are provided for suggesting how a particular user should configure a particular account configuration parameter of a plurality of account configuration parameters available to the particular user. One or more parameters of the plurality of account configuration parameters that are related to the particular parameter are identified. One or more other users are identified that have configured the one or more parameters similar to how the particular user has configured the one or more parameters. A suggestion of how the particular user should configure the particular parameter is made based on settings for the particular parameter made by the one or more other users.",9141673
