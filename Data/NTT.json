The wave washer presses apart the third waveguide and the waveguide assembly such that the contact end of the first waveguide is pressed into contact with the CCA circuit surface and the third waveguide is pressed into contact with an external circuit disposed above the housing.", "patent_id": "9935347"}, {"patent_number": "9939252", "patent_date": "2018-04-10", "patent_num_combined_citations": "2", "patent_kind": "B2", "patent_title": "Target locating device and methods", "patent_abstract": "A target location device has a video camera, a range finder, a self location module and an inertial measurement unit.
